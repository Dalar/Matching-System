# Ubuntu install instructions
#
# Here's how I think I installed this from scratch on Ubuntu, though
# I didn't write these down as I went so might misremember the order
# of some steps etc... gl hf :)

# grab current installation
git clone https://github.com/Dalar/Matching-System.git

sudo apt-get update

# I think most of these were already installed but just in case
sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv mongodb mysql-server python-dev
sudo apt-get install python-scipy

sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# if the following line doesn't work, then try doing
#    sudo apt-get install npm
# first: npm should have come with nodejs but I think it didn't
# for me
sudo npm install npm -g

npm config set prefix '~/.npm-packages'
sudo pico ~/.bashrc

# append the following line to bashrc, then save and close:
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.npm-packages/bin"

# back on the command line
source ~/.bashrc

npm install -g bower
npm install -g grunt-cli

# now navigate to the root of the git project you cloned, if you're not
# there already
cd Matching-System

# at some point one of the installers might ask you whether to use a
# library that angular needs or a library that Matching-Project needs,
# I chose to use the one that M-P needs and it seemed to work okay

virtualenv venv/
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

npm install
grunt
bower install

bower install angular-route

# if you're exceedingly lucky, everything should now be installed and
# ready to work
# 
# to actually run the thing, run the run_server.sh script and then
# navigate your browser to http://localhost:8899/ for the new version
# or http://localhost:8899/index for the old version
